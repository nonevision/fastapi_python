## Features 🧩

- **Docker** and **docker-compose** for local development
- **FastAPI** application with **uvicorn** server
- **AsyncPG** for asynchronous access to PostgreSQL
- **Pydantic** for data validation
- **Poetry** for managing Python dependencies
- **Alembic** for database migrations
- **Pre-commit** hooks for code formatting and linting
- **JWT** token authentication

## User flow as an example of how to use the template 💡

- It consists of the following steps:
```
    - Register a new user
    - Login with the new user
    - Change password
    - Get all users
    - Delete user by id
    - Delete all users
```
- This following example will show you the pattern and good practices to follow in order to continue developing your application.
